# Advent of Code Starter Template
## Welcome to *Advent of Code*
Advent of Code (AoC) is an annual coding challenge that takes place during the holiday season. It was created by Eric Wastl and has since become a popular event among programmers, with thousands of participants from around the world.

The basic idea behind AoC is simple: for 25 days, starting on December 1st, you'll receive a new puzzle to solve every morning. These puzzles are usually related to programming, algorithms, or data structures, and they're designed to be challenging but solvable within a reasonable amount of time.

### Apollo Engineering ❤️ Advent of Code

- **Foster a culture of learning and collaboration** : AoC encourages teamwork, open communication, and mutual support, which are essential skills for any successful engineering team.
- **Develop problem-solving skills** : By tackling challenging puzzles every day, participants will improve their ability to think critically, approach problems from different angles, and find creative solutions.
- **Enhance coding skills** : AoC helps developers stay up-to-date with the latest programming concepts, algorithms, and data structures, making them more versatile and adaptable in their work.
- **Promote a positive work environment** : By taking breaks during the day to participate in the challenge, team members can recharge, refocus, and return to their tasks with renewed energy and motivation.
